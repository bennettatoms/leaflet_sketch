### Description

This is an exercise in embedding interactive Leaflet maps in an angularJS/Rails project.

-	Six different base layers from Stamen (watercolor, terrain, and toner), Open Cycle, OSM, and MapQuest (satellite), which users can change with a dropdown in the upper righthand corner of the map
- Hard-coded LatLng coordinates that comprise a layer of the map which the user can choose to display or not, within the same dropdown as above
-	Markers bound to popups -- images and text
-	Customized polylines between markers
-	Routing between markers using [Leaflet Routing Machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) plugin
